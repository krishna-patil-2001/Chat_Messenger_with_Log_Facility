# Chat_Messenger_with_Log_Facility

Project Overview
  
This project is a Java-based  peer-to-peer chat application that enables real-time text-based communication between users using  Java Socket Programming.
Along with providing basic chat functionality, it also maintains a log file that records all conversation details in a periodic  fashion for future reference.
the application is platform and architecture independent, running on any sytsem with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

 Key Features

 * Peer-to-Peer Communication
   - Uses Java Socket for direct communication between clients.

 * Real-Time Chat
   - Enables instant text-based messenging between connected peers.

 * Chat Log Maintanence
   - Logs all chats history with timestamps into a file.
   - provides periodic logging for orgnized record-keeping.

 * Cross Platform
   - Runs seamlessly across diffrent operating systems and architectures.

 * Lightweight & Extensible
   - can be extended to support group chat, fle sharing, or encryption.

Learning Outcomes

 * Practical knowledge of Java Socket Programming (TCP/IP).
 * Hands-on experience with network programming concepts (client-server, peer-to-peer).
 * Implementation of logging mechanisms in applications.
 * Understanding of platform-independent communication in java.
 * Foundation of building scalable chat/messaging applications.
